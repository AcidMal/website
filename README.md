# My Website (Built with Astro)

Welcome to my website project! ðŸŽ‰

This website is being built using **Astro**, a modern front-end framework that allows for fast, optimized web experiences. The site is currently a **work in progress**, but I am actively working on it and learning along the way.

## About the Project

The goal of this project is to:
- Create a simple, personal website to showcase my learning journey.
- Learn and improve my **HTML** and **CSS** skills.
- Experiment with **Astro** and explore its powerful features, such as static site generation and integration with other web technologies.

While the website may not be feature-complete yet, I'm excited to share my progress as I continue to improve it.

## Features

- **Astro**: Using Astro to build static pages with fast performance.
- **HTML & CSS**: I am actively learning and implementing HTML and CSS to style and structure the site.
- **Responsive Design**: I am working on ensuring that the website looks good on all devices.

## Current Progress

- Basic structure of the site is set up.
- Homepage has been built but is still a work in progress, with a simple layout and design.
- Basic Blog page has been set up with one blog post.
- Learning HTML and CSS to implement the site's styles and features.

## Roadmap

Here are a few things I'm planning to work on next:
- Improve styling with CSS for a more polished look.
- Add additional pages like a portfolio and ~~blog~~.
- Implement more advanced features using **JavaScript** and **Astro components**.
- Improve the Blog posts by adding a CMS system. So I can upload more efficiently.
- ~~Fix Styling and make pages feel more lively.~~
- Make page more dynamic and interactive.
